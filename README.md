## Hey, my name is Victor! How are you feeling today?

🧑🏻 I am a 23-year-old React and Blazor Front-End Developer and also an university student who loves Graphic Design and Computation. My main working style involves building modern user interfaces, exploring usability and Graphic Design principles to create dynamic and modularized applications with reusable, clean, atomic and customized components.

🖥️ Currently, I'm working at LogisticMobile Technology as Full-Stack Developer to Warehouse Management Systems solutions.

🚀I'm diving into React.js, JavaScript and Blazor development, Figma Prototyping, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, Material UI stylization, Atomic Design, UI/UX, Usability Heuristics and Graphic Design principles for Front-End development. I intend to learn much more about it and some hobby areas like Game Development and Theology as well.
